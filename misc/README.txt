Welcome to Impro-Visor (Improvisation Advisor) Version 5.05,
from Prof. Bob Keller at Harvey Mudd College.

If you need help, please post to the Yahoo! impro-visor user group:

    http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/impro-visor/

From the group, you may also obtain The Imaginary Book which contains a
large number of chords-only leadsheets, as well as other useful
resources.

Impro-Visor is free and runs on any platform that supports Java 1.6 or
later, including:
 
    Windows (XP, 2000, Vista, 7)
    MacOSX (Snow Leopard 10.6 or later needed for Java 1.6)
    Linux 

The official information site for Impro-Visor is:

    https://www.cs.hmc.edu/~keller/jazz/improvisor

which is the same as

    http://www.impro-visor.com

The official download site for Impro-Visor is sourceForge:

    http://sourceforge.net/projects/impro-visor/

Download the installer that is provided for your platform, then launch the installer.

Once the program is installed, there should be a launcher

    Impro-Visor

that will run the program itself. The first time the program is run it
will set up a folder in your user home for your personal version of
various files.

Alternatively, you may run by double-clicking the file: 

    improvisor.jar

which is a Java archive.

(You cannot start the application by clicking on individual leadsheet
files. They must be opened from within.)
 
You can download the latest version of Java free from:

           http://www.java.com/download/
 
What you want is the JRE (Java Runtime Environment).


I am pleased to acknowledge contributions from the following developers:

Stephen Jones, Aaron Wolin
David Morrison, Martin Hunt, Steven Gomez
Jim Herold, Brandy McMenamy, Sayuri Soejima
Emma Carlson, Jon Gillick, Kevin Tang, Stephen Lee

We hope you enjoy using the program.
