The menus can also be used to refresh your memory.\n\nGrid Lines:\n\n\tGrid lines indicate potential note, rest, and chord starting and ending points. \n\tGrid lines appear in a measure when the mouse is moved over it.\n\tMultiple adjacent grid lines may be selected.\n\tSome commands, such as Advice, only function if a single grid line is selected.\n\tIf one or more grid lines are selected, we call this \"the selection\".\n\nTo select a grid line, or to extend a selection:\n\n\tSelected grid lines are shown by high-lighting the line and any note on it.\n\n\tIf no grid line is already selected, shift-click on the desired grid line.\n\tIf a grid line is already selected, shift-click twice on the desired grid line.\n\n\tShift-clicking on a grid line inside the selection causes just that grid line to be selected.\n\tShift-clicking on a grid line outside the selection extends the selection to include that grid line.\n\tControl-a selects all grid lines at once.\n\tEscape unselects everything.\n\tIf a single grid line is selected, it can be moved back and forth using keys f and a.\n\nEntering notes:\n\n\tClick on the intersection of any grid line and staff line or space.\n\tAlternatively, notes can be entered in the text entry field using leadsheet notation.\n\tAccidentals:\n\t\tUse keys e and d to raise and lower notes by half step.\n\t\tUse the space bar to change an accidental enharmonically.\n\t\tUse keys t and g to raise and lower notes by octave.\n\tIf you make a mistake entering a note, just click another note on the same grid line.\n\tYou may also undo one or more note entry actions with key z.\n\tThe duration values of notes will be long when you first click.\n\tClick over the tied portion to enter the next note in a sequence.\n\tIf you want a rest, click a note or select a grid line, then press key r.\n\t\nRemoving notes:\n\n\tSelect the grid line that begins the note you want to remove. Then press either r or x.\n\tPressing r will replace the note with a rest.\n\tPressing x will remove the note, but extend the value of the previous note over it.\n\nExtending the duration of a note:\n\n\tIf the note to be extended is followed by a rest, select the grid line of that starts the rest,then press x.\n\nEntering chords:\n\n\tEnter the chord names in the text entry field, pressing enter when desired.\n\tChords will be entered starting at the first grid line selected.\n\tIf there is no grid line selected, nothing will happen.\n\tUse bars | to indicate measures.\n\tChords are spaced evenly within a measure. \n\tUse / to indicate more time for the previous chord.\n\tExample:\t| A B C / |\tmeans that C gets twice the value that A and B get.\n\tUse keys E and D to raise or lower a chord by half steps.\n\nCopying a selection:\n\n\tFirst create the selection by shift clicking as described above.\n\tPress c to copy the notes in the selection.\n\tPress C to copy the chords in the selection.\n\tPress control-c to copy both notes and chords.\n\tCopying takes place to a \"clip-board\" that is not visible.\n\tThe copied selection is not removed.\n\nPasting a selection:\n\n\tPasting is done from the invisible \"clip-board\" mentioned above.\n\tFirst select a single grid line.\n\tPress v to paste the notes previously copied or cut.\n\tPress V to paste the chords previously copied or cut.\n\tPress control-v to paste both notes and chords.\n\tThe selection can be pasted multiple times in different positions.\n\nCutting a selection:\n\n\tCutting is like copying, except the selection is removed as well.\n\tFirst create the selection by shift clicking as described above.\n\tPress x to copy the notes in the selection.\n\tPress X to copy the chords in the selection.\n\tPress control-x to copy both notes and chords.\n\tBoth cut and copy put notes and chords into the \"clip-board\".\n\nUndoing a paste or cut:\n\n\tUse key z to undo.\n\tMultiple undos are allowed.\n\tUse key y to redo something you just undid.\n\nPasting from the text entry field:\n\n\tBoth chords and notes can be entered through the text entry field.\n\tPressing return enters the contents at the current selection.\n\tOne can also select a grid line then re-enter the text entry items at that point as follows:\n\t\tPress b to enter the notes only.\n\t\tPress B to enter the chords only.\n\t\tPress control-b to enter both notes and chords.\n\nCopying a selection from the staff to the text entry:\n\n\tThis is a good way to learn leadsheet notation.\n\tCreate a selection.\n\tPress j to copy the notes in the selection to the text entry.\n\tPress J to copy the chords in the selection to the text entry.\n\tPress control-j to copy the notes and chords in the selection to the text entry.\n\nTransposing an entire selection:\n\n\tUse d to transpose selected notes down 1/2 step.\n \tUse D to transpose selected chords down 1/2 step.\n\tUse control-d to transpose selected notes and chords down 1/2 step.\n\tUse g to transpose selected notes down an octave.\n\tUse s to transpose selected notes down harmonically about 1/2 step.\n\n\tUse e to transpose selected notes up 1/2 step.\n \tUse E to transpose selected chords up 1/2 step.\n\tUse control-e to transpose selected notes and chords up 1/2 step.\n\tUse t to transpose selected notes up an octave.\n\tUse w to transpose selected notes up harmonically about 1/2 step.\n\nPlaying a selection or the entire piece:\n\n\tWith the mouse in the staff window, press enter to play the selection (notes and chords).\n\tPress shift-enter to play from the selection to the end of the leadsheet.\n\tPress i to play the entire leadsheet.\n\tPress k to stop playback.\n \nSaving licks, cells, idioms, or quotes:\n\n\tSelect what you want to save.\n\tPress u. A dialog will open that allows you to select the type and name the item.\n\nMarking and unmarking licks, cells, idioms, or quotes:\n\n\tMarking allows you to find the marked item in the vocabulary file using a text editor.\n\tUse M to mark a lick, cell, idiom, or quote.\n\tUse m to unmark an already-marked item.\n\nOther composer functions:\n\n\tUse R to rectify (align to harmony) the notes in the selected  melody.\n\tUse / to reverse the notes in the selected  melody.\n\tUse \\ to invert the notes in the selected melody.\n\nLeadsheet file commands:\n\n\tUse control-o to open an existing leadsheet.\n\tUse control-s to save the current leadsheet under the same name.\n\tUse control-w to save the current leadsheet under a new name.\n\tUse control-r to revert the leadsheet to the last saved version. Changes since then are lost.\n\tUse control-n to open a new leadsheet. The current one stays in its own window.\n\nMiscellaneous:\n\tUse control-l to perform a one-time auto-layout adjustment of the measures per line.\n\tTo set a specific number of measures per line: shift click on the line, then select \"Over-ride ... \".\n\tControl-q quits improvisor.\n\n\n");

        soloGenInstructions.setText("Help for the Theme Weaver\n\nThe Theme Weaver is a tool that can be used to generate solos by using one \nor multiple 'themes' and the generated solo style or player the user has chosen.\nIn addition to some pre-entered themes and generating a theme, you can also write \nyour own and save them for later use. The Theme Weaver takes in seven weighted \nvalues (or probabilities). The first determines whether a theme will be used. If it used, \nit then decides if it will be transformed in six different ways: transposed, inverted, \nreversed, expanded, side slipped, or bar line shifted. If a theme is not used, the\nspace in the solo will be filled with a melody based on the chosen style or player in \nthe main window. The user can experiment with different values and themes to find \nwhat works best. The table acts as their workspace.\n\n\nHighlighting a Cell\n\nThere are two ways to highlight a cell: \n\t* Click once on the cell \nOr if you have just entered something into the cell: \n\t* Press 'Enter'\n\nYou will know your cell is highlighted if it is blue.\n \n\nGenerating a Theme\n\n\t1. Type in an integer for the length of the theme, such as '6'\n\t    or '7' into a cell in the 'Length' labeled column. The length \n\t    represents the number of beats in the generated theme.\t\n\n\t2. Make sure after each length you type in, you press 'Enter' or \n\t    click out of the cell. \n\n\t3. Click the button 'Generate Theme'.\n\nA theme in leadsheet notation should appear in the Theme cell(s) to the right \nof the Length cell(s) you chose. \n\nIf you have already generated several themes and you only want to change one \nof them, highlight the Length cell of the theme you want to change and then \nclock the button 'Generate Theme' and only the theme for that highlighted \ncell will change. \n\n\nThemes Scroll Box \n\nTo the right of the table, there is a scroll box labeled 'Themes'. This is where\nyour saved themes will appear. If you want to use one of the themes in the scroll \nbox, make sure to click anywhere in the Solo Generator window, then click \nthe theme you desire in the scroll box. The theme will appear in the first empty \nrow in the table along with its corresponding name and theme length in the name \nand length cells to the left of it.\n\nIf you click a click a theme more than once so it will appear in the table multiple \ntimes, it will appear in the table labeled with a number representing what number\ncopy it is, such as 'Jingle Bells - 1,'' and will be added and saved to the Themes Scroll Box. \n\nIf you want to hear a theme in the scroll box to decide if you want to use it, \npress the 'Shift' key and hold it down, then click the theme you want to hear. \n\nIf you want to delete a theme, select the theme you wish to be deleted, then \nclick the 'Delete Theme From File' button. \n\n\nListening to a Theme in the Table \n\nIf you want to listen to a theme that it is in your table, press the 'Shift' key \nand hold it down, then click any cell in the row of the theme you want to hear. \n\n\nGenerating a Solo\n\n \t* Make sure that for every theme in your table, the 'Use', 'Transpose', \n\t  'Invert', 'Reverse', 'Expand', 'Side Slip', and 'Bar Line Shift' cells are all \n\t   filled in with weighted values from 0 to 1, as well as the 'Theme Prob' \n\t   text field, representing how much you want the theme to be used, t\n\t   ransposed, inverted, reversed, expanded, side slipped, bar line shifted \n\t   or not used at all. \n\n\t* Make sure after every value you type in, you press 'Enter' \n\t  or click out of the cell to ensure the value has been entered. \n\n\t* Make sure the 'Theme Use Interval' text field is filled in with an \n\t   integer that represents the length of the intervals that the solo\n          \t   will be broken up into.\n        \n\t* Then click the button 'Generate Solo'. \n\nA solo will appear in your open leadsheet and will be played. \n\n\nGenerate Solo Scroll Box \n\nAfter you generate a solo, in the empty scroll box beneath the table, you will see the \nname of the theme used in the solo and whether it was transposed, inverted, reversed,\nexpanded, side slipped, or bar line shifted.\nIf the theme has no name, it will appear as 'null'.  If the name \nof the theme is not transformed, 'unmodified' will appear after the name.\n\n\nNaming\n \nAfter adding a theme you have generated or typed in yourself to the dictionary\nof themes in the Themes scroll box to the right of the table, you have \nto name it. The first column of the table is the \"Name\" column as shown \nby the label at the top. \n\n\t1. Double-click the name cell in the row of the theme you want\n\t    to save.\n\n\t2. Then type in the name of your choice and then either  \n\t\t*  press 'Enter' or\n\t\t*  click out of the cell.\n\nThe name will appear in the Themes scroll box at the bottom.  \n\n\nUsing Leadsheet Selections as Themes\n\nIf there is a string of notes already in the leadsheet that you want to use -  \n\n\t1. Click where the section starts then drag over the section until\n\t    all the notes you want are highlighted.\n\n\t2. Click the button 'Use Current Selection in Leadsheet Window as Theme'.  \n\nThe theme should appear in the first empty row in the table with its corresponding \nlength in the length cell to the left of it.\n\nTransformation Order\n\nAs you can imagine, the order that the transformations are executed in will change \nthe final product. In the middle of the window, you can choose the transformation \norder. Enter the desired order from top to bottom. You cannot enter the same \ntransformation twice. \n\nRange\n\nTo set the range of the whole solo, press the 'Choose Range' button. \n\nEditing Themes\n\nIf you want, you can make your own edits to current themes in your table. \nOnce you press 'Enter' or click out of the cell, the theme length integer in \nthe length cell will change accordingly. \n\n\nEditing Table Items\n\n\t* To clear the entire table and restore any rows you deleted, click the 'Reset' button.\n\n\t* To delete a whole row, highlight any cell in the row you want to delete and press\n\t   the \"Delete\" button on your keyboard or click the 'Delete Selected Row' button \n\t   below the table.\n\n\t* To enter in probabilities of using the theme, transposing, inverting, etc. faster, you\n\t  can set all the probabilities equal to the first theme. Once you’ve entered your \n\t  desired probabilities in the first row, click 'Set All Probabilities Equal To 1st Theme'.\n\n\t* To reset all the probabilities to zero, press 'Reset Theme Probabilities To Zero'.\n\n\t* To set all the theme probabilities to the same value, enter the desired probability\n\t   in the text area at the bottom and press the 'Set Probabilities' button. \n\nTransformation Preferences\n\nThere are separate preferences windows for the expand, side slip, and bar line shift \ntransformations. To open these windows, press the 'Open Transformation Preferences'\nbutton (where Transformation is the corresponding desired transformation).\n\n\nPlaying\n\n\t* To stop playing a solo, click the 'Stop Playing' button. Once you click it, you will \n\t   see the button change to saying 'Play Solo'\n\n\t* To play the solo you have stopped click the 'Play Solo' button. Once you click it, it\n           will switch back to saying 'Stop Playing'");

To begin, you can choose the theme you want to use\nby clicking on it. Make sure the name of the theme is displayed at the top of the window where\nit says 'Chosen Theme:'. If you want to create your own theme, you can go into the regular Theme\nWeaver and follow the steps to use a selected melody from the leadsheet as a theme. Once \nyou name it, it will be available to use in the Custom Theme Weaver.\n\nStep 2: Choosing Transformations\n\nChoose the transformations you would like to apply by clicking the corresponding button. For\nsome transformations there are other options you need to choose, or else the default settings\nwill be used. You need to select the transformations you want to use in the order that you wish \nfor them to be used in.

Styles \nare specified in the vocabulary file as a set of patterns for each instrument\nof the accompaniment.  There are also style parameters that determine how\nthe patterns are used.\n\nPatterns\n\nEach pattern is defined by a set of rules.  The rules are similar to\nleadsheet notation, except the pitch is replaced with a capital letter\nindicating the rule.  Each pattern also has a weight that determines how\noften that pattern is used in relation to other patterns of the same length.\n\nChord Patterns\n\nChord patterns determine only the rhythm of the chord accompaniment. (The \nvoicings to use are decided based on a voice-leading algorithm.)\n\nChord patterns use the following rules:\n\nX       Strike the chord\nR       A rest\n\nBass Patterns\n\nBass patterns determine both the rhythm of the bassline and the type of\nnotes that are chosen.\n\nBass patterns use the following rules, where d is a duration, such as\n4 for a quarter-note, 8 for an eighth-note, etc.\n\nBd      The bass note (either the root of the chord, or the note specified\n        as part of a slash chord)\n\nCd      A note from the current chord\n\nSd      A note from the first scale associated with the current chord\n\nAd      A tone that approaches the bass note of the next chord\n\nNd      The bass note of the next chord (if at the end of a pattern\n        it will tie over to the next pattern)\n\nRd      A rest of duration d\n\n=d      The same note as the previous note, ignoring rests.\n\n(X n d) A specific note from the first scale given for a chord in\n        the vocabulary. For example (X 5 4) will give a quarter-note\n        on the fifth-degree of the scale.\n\n(X bn d) or (X #n d)\n        A specific note from the first scale given for a chord in\n        the vocabulary, lowered or raised a half step using standard\n        flat/sharp notation.  For example (X b5 4) will give a\n        quarter-note on a half step below the fifth-degree of the scale.\n\nU/D notation\n        When inputting multiple notes into a bass pattern, placing\n        U or D between notes will guarantee a rise or drop from the\n        first note to the next.  For example, B4 U C4 D (X 2 4)\n        will give a bass note, followed by an ascending color tone,\n        followed by a descending second-degree note.       \n\n\nDrum Patterns\n\nDrum patterns are a bit more complicated in that for one pattern you must\nspecify a drum \"rule\" for each drum you want in the pattern.

The software will attempt\n     to fill space with the largest pattern it can.  Try to correspond pattern\n     lengths to the probable chord durations.  If chords will mostly last for\n     4 beats, then have a 4 beat pattern.  If chords will last for 8 beats,\n     the software can fill that in with two 4 beat patterns.  Having a 1 beat\n     pattern for each accompaniment instrument is a good idea as a failsafe\n     for unconventional chord durations.\n\n   * Adding the parameter (no-style) to your style will cause the software\n     to leave out any bassline or drum part and play chords exactly where \n     they are specified on the leadsheet.\n\n   * Look to the styles included in the vocabulary file as a guide to\n     creating your own styles.\n\n   * Don't be afraid to experiment, but also don't be afraid to keep \n     things simple.\n");

This makes it easy to sketch out \nthe 'melody contour' of your solo fluidly, without having to click at each\nindividual space.\n\nNote Fitting\n\nThe Draw tool does its best to fit notes along the curve you draw.  That is,\nit will add the pitch that roughly correponds to the stave note under\nthe cursor.  Since a melody contour defines the shape of the pitches\nin the music - but not necessarily specific pitches - the Draw tool allows\nyou to ignore harmonic rules when sketching out this shape; it will match\npitches to the nearest harmonious ones, for the current chord.  When\nno chord (\"NC\") is in effect, the Draw tool fits notes using the major\nscale of the score's key.\n\nNote Duration\n\nThe duration of notes on the drawn contour is determined by the note-\nspacing you can set below each measure.  If you want a triplet, for \nexample, in a particular measure, you can simply set the rhythm there\n(by dragging out the note spacing) and draw over that measure.  Notes\nwill automatically be fitted along the curve you draw, to that rhythm.\n\nDrawing Tips\n\n   * You can extend a note while drawing by holding the Shift key.  This\n     will 'flatline' the melody contour and increase the duration of the\n     current note being drawn. \n\n   * To add rest while drawing, you can hold the Control key.  Drawing\n     over the stave with Control down will insert rest there.  You may\n     also press 'R' while a given note is selected to insert rest there.\n\n   * When drawing over chord changes, you may want to force a tone\n     that 'approaches' the change before a given chord.  By holding\n     Shift-A, the Draw tool will always add an approach tone before a\n     chord change, and then resolve to the nearest chord tone.\n\n   * If you draw too quickly, the tool might \"miss\" a note, and not fit\n     it to the curve right away.  Don't panic!  Any notes that aren't fitted\n     properly will conform to the curve once you release the mouse button.\n\n   * Post-edit!  If you want to change a note or two, edit them after you\n     finish sketching.  Adjusting the pitch is easy; just drag up and down\n     on a note.  Using the keyboard controls, it's also easy to add rest\n     or extend notes afterwards.\n\n   * Want to hear the notes as they're being drawn?  Unmute the entry\n     sounds on the mixer, and Impro-Visor will remember your \n     preference during this session.  If you always want to hear them\n     by default, you may toggle the default settings under \n     \"Preferences -> Contour Drawing\".\n\n   * Maybe you only want the Draw tool to add chord tones or color\n     tones, rather than all scale tones.  Impro-Visor allows you to \n     set the Draw tool pitches under \"Preferences -> Contour Drawing\".\n");

The chords will\nbe displayed as a list of \"blocks\": either individual chords or chords grouped\ntogether into \"bricks\".\n\nThere are three levels to a road map: the key level, the block level, and the \nchord level. At the top level is a color-coded key map, which shows the general\nkey at a certain point in a tune. The coloration is based upon position around\nthe circle of fifths; the nearer two colors are in the spectrum, the closer they\nare in the circle of fifths. If the key is minor or dominant rather than major,\nit takes the color of its relative major counterpart. If you don't like the \ncoloration, you can always go to File -> Roadmap Information and uncheck \"Key\nColoration\".\n\nNext, at the block level, one can see the names of any bricks present. An \nunanalyzed piece will have no names here, as everything will be broken into\nchords. When analyzed, the names of bricks grouping these chords together \nwill appear in the middle bar if any such grouping exists. If a brick overlaps\nanother brick, a \"+ ...\" will appear. If insufficient space exists to display\nthe brick's full name, you'll just see a \"...\". To see the full name, mouse \nover the brick.\n\nFinally, the chords themselves are shown at the bottom level with their durations.\nThese can be any chords accepted by Impro-Visor itself, and will usually be pulled\nfrom the leadsheet open in Impro-Visor's main window.\n\nSometimes, below the end of a brick, a yellow box with a word will appear. This\ndescribes the kind of \"join\" that exists between two blocks. Joins are named \nbased upon the interval between the key of two blocks:a Homer joins two bricks \nin the same key, a Cherokee joins two bricks with the second a half-step up from\nthe first, , a Woody joins two bricks a whole step apart, etc. The list of all \njoins in order based on number of half-steps up the second key is from the\nfirst key is: \n         0: Homer (same key)           6:  Stella (tritone)\n         1: Cherokee (half step up)    7:  Backslider (fourth down)\n         2: Woody (whole step up)      8:  Half Nelson (major third down)\n         3: Highjump (minor third up)  9:  Sidewinder (minor third down)\n         4: Bauble (major third up)    10: New Horizon (whole step down)\n         5: Bootstrap (fourth up)      11: Downwinder (half step down)\n\nThese joins will only appear between a brick ending in a stable chord and a \nbrick beginning in an unstable chord, so don't be surprised if there are\nnot joins between all bricks.\n\nEnds of blocks will sometimes have a doubled line. This indicates that the\nblock is the end of a section (two thick lines) or a phrase (a thin line and a\nthick line). Sections and phrases are notated in a leadsheet file with the \nparenthetical expressions \n  (section (style = [style name]))\nand\n  (phrase)\nrespectively. These help both to display the roadmap in a way that keeps\nsections distinct and to keep analysis from making bricks that overlap two\nsections or phrases.\n\nIf you wish to change the width of the contents of the roadmap, you can use\nthe Feature Width slider on the top toolbar to make the contents more easily\nviewable. If brick names are difficult to view due to the feature width, you\ncan mouse over difficult-to-view bricks and the full name will show.\n\n\nBrick Dictionary\n\nThe Brick Dictionary contains a list of possible bricks for you to use in\na given piece. This also is the list of possible bricks that could appear in\nthe analyzed version of a piece. Each brick has a type which describes the\npurpose that brick serves in a given piece: sometimes, a \"Cadence\", for \ninstance, starts from an unresolved chord and progresses to a resolution.\n\nYou can select a brick in the dictionary by navigating through the tree, first\nlooking for the type, then the brick name. Sometimes, a brick will have several\nvariants; in this case, you can either select the folder with that name to get\nthe default, or you can open the folder to view one of the brick variants.\n\nWhen a brick is selected, it displays in the Brick Preview pane as it would if\nit were inserted into the roadmap. From there, one can use the drop-down menus\nbelow the dictionary to select the key of a given brick or the relative duration\nof the brick. When one is satisfied with the appearance of a given brick, one \ncan drag it from the brick preview pane to the desired location in the current \nroadmap to insert it.\n\nIf you don't want to see a brick in the library or on the roadmap, you can \nselect the brick in the tree and then press the \"Delete Selected Library Brick\"\nbutton. This will take the brick out of the visible library. Careful when you\ndelete a brick, though: if you want to restore it in the dictionary, you will\nneed to open the BrickDictionary.txt file in the \"vocab\" folder of the \nImpro-Visor application, find the definition, and change the word \"Invisible\"\nback to the correct brick type.\n\n\nManipulating the Roadmap\n\nIn order to change either parts or the entirety of the roadmap, you have to \nselect the parts of the roadmap you wish to change. You can select these parts\nby clicking on them. To select a single block, click on it. To select multiple,\nclick on the starting block, then hold Shift and click on the ending block. All\nthe blocks from the first to the second will be selected. If you wish to select\nthe entire leadsheet, type \"A\" or click \"Select All\" in the Edit menu..\n\nWhen you have a selection, you can perform several transformations on the \nselected block(s):\n\n   * To transpose the key up a semitone, press \"E\"; to transpose it down a \n     semitone, press \"D\".\n\n   * You can change the duration of a given selection by selecting the \"Scale\n     Duration\" menu in the top toolbar. It will scale the selection to the \n     given fraction or multiple of the current duration.\n\n   * You can cut or copy a set of chords by pressing \"X\" or \"C\", respectively.\n     These can then be pasted before a selection (or at the end of the chord\n     sequence if there is no selection) by typing \"V\" later. These operations \n     are also all available in the Edit menu.\n\n   * To delete the selection, press the Delete/Backspace key. You can also\n     delete selections from the Edit menu.\n\n   * You can undo a modification by pressing \"Z\". If you wish to redo the \n     operation, pressing \"Y\" will return the roadmap to the state before the\n     undo. These operations are also available in the Edit menu.\n\n   * You can modify a particular chord by clicking on the chord name itself\n     within a selection. If you double-click the chord, you can change its name\n     and duration. Only valid chord names will be accepted. Changing a chord in\n     a brick will break the brick up.\n\n   * To \"break\" a selection into the blocks that make it up, click on the \n     \"Break\" button in the top toolbar, or select \"Break Selection\" in the \n    Edit menu. \n\n   * To \"flatten\" a selection into the chords that make it up, click on the\n     \"Flatten button in the top toolbar, or select \"Flatten Selection\" in the\n     Edit menu.\n\n   * To add a selection as a new brick in the Brick Library, click the \"New\n     Brick\" button in the top toolbar. This will open a dialog window where you\n     can name the brick and select its key, type, and mode.\n\n   * One of the most useful tools in the roadmap is the Analyze button, which \n     will take the whole piece or a selection and split it into the best \n     combination of bricks it can find. Generally, this will take a few seconds,\n     so be patient. If you aren't happy with the resulting bricks, try taking \n     selections from what you want to analyze and analyzing them individually,\n     or redefining where section divisions are in the roadmap.\n\n   * To change whether or not a given selection ends a section, you can type\n     Return or click \"Toggle Section\" in the Section menu. Alternatively, if you\n     wish for the selection to be the end of a phrase, you can type Shift+Return\n     or click \"Toggle Phrase\" in the Section menu. A brick can end either a \n     section or a phrase, but not both.\n\nAdditionally, the Roadmap supports playback of a given selection. If you press\nthe \"play\" button (the triangle on the top toolbar), a MIDI matching the chords\nfor a given section and the style on the leadsheet will play. Hitting the \"stop\"\nbutton (the square on the top toolbar) will stop playback, and one can toggle\nwhether the playback will loop or not by clicking the \"Loop\" button on the top\ntoolbar. If nothing is selected, playback will default to the whole of the tune.\n\n\n");

        lickGenSettings.setText("Help for the Lick Generator\n\nThe lick generator and triage tool is a powerful and customizable\nutility that will create original licks over a given series of chord\nchanges.\n\nThe lick generator creates things in two steps; first, it generates\na rhythm using a context-free grammar.  Then, it fills in this\nrhythm probabilistically.  This allows for a large variety of \ndifferent melodys.  The grammar is specified in the text field under\n\"Grammar File.\"  This file is customizable and uses the following\nformat for terminal values:\n\n<Note type><Value>\n\nNote type can be one of\n     * X - any note\n     * R - a rest\n     * C - a chord tone (as specified in the vocabulary file)\n     * L - a color tone (as specified in the vocabulary file)\n     * S - a scale tone (as specified by the user.  If \"None\" is chosen, \n\tthis is ignored.  If use first scale is chosen, it looks\n\tat the first scale in the vocabulary file associated \n\twith the given chord.  If there is no such scale, this\n\tis ignored).\n     * A - an approach tone (forces the following note to be a\n \tchord tone, and approaches from a half step\n\tabove or below).\n\nValue can be from 1 (4 beats) to 16/3 (sixteenth note triplets).  \nLonger note values are not currently supported in the grammar.\n\nFor a more detailed explanation of how to modify the grammar\nfile, please see the \"Lick Generator\" tutorial.\n\nA few notes on parameter setting in grammars:\nThe expectancy for the generated line is calculated as \n(expectancy-multiplier)(expectancy value of previous line) + \n(normalized expectancy-constant (where 1 is the highest value)). \nA higher expectancy value means more highly expected notes will show up \nin the generated line.\nWhile this gives many options for expectancies, most users will not find\na use for expectancy-multiplier that is not 1 or 0 (i.e. follows the user or\nuses a constant expectancy value).\nExpectancy-constant can range from 0 to 1 but a pretty normal value for\nthis is around a 0.6 to 0.7\n\nThe syncopation-multiplier and syncopation-constant work in exactly \nthe same way but a typical value for syncopation-constant is around 0.15\n\nIf you do not wish to use the context-free grammar to generate a\nrhythm, deselect the \"Use Grammar\" button.  This tends to create\nless listenable fragments, however.\n\nBy default, the lick generator will tend to avoid repeating the same\nnote multiple times in a row.  If you would like to turn this off,\ndeselect the \"Avoid Repeat Pitch\" button.\n\n\"Generate\" creates a rhythm and fills it in using the probabilities.\n\n\"Generate Rhythm\" only creates a rhythm.\n\n\"Fill Melody\" generates a melody for a given rhythm (the rhythm\nis specified in the large text box; note that you can manually enter\nlonger note values here using leadsheet notation, as in X2+4 for\na three beat note)\n\n\"Get Selected Rhythm\" will read the rhythmic pattern of whatever\nis currently selected.\n\n\"Replay\" replays the current selection.\n\n\"Help\" displays this dialog.\n\n\"Reload\" will re-parse the grammar file.\n\n\"Save Lick\" saves the lick into the vocabulary.\n\nThe lick generator will automatically determine note probabilities \nfor all chords in the from the current selection start up to the\ntotal number of beats specified.  If you would like to disable this\nfeature, deselect the \"Auto-fill probabilities\" check box.  The\n\"Fill\" button will reset them to their defaults, and the \"Clear\" button\nsets them all to zero.\n\nOther options:\n     * Min/Max Pitch: Do not use pitches higher or lower than these\n\tvalues.\n\n     * Min/Max Interval: Do not jump higher or lower than this interval\n\tunless a jump probability is set.\n\n     * Min/Max Duration (only used if the grammar is disabled): Do\n\tnot generate notes with rhythmic values longer or\n\tshorter than these; note that these are inverse, so\n\t32 indicates a 32nd note and 1 indicates a whole note.\n\n     * Beats: The length of the lick to generate in beats.  This value is \n\tbased off of the current selection.\n\n     * Rest Probability (only used if the grammar is disabled): The\n\tprobability of a given note being a rest.\n\n     * Leap Probability: The probability of jumping outside the\n\tmaximum interval (see above).");

When a new transform is opened over a \ntransform with unsaved changes, the program will prompt you to save. If the application is being \nclosed however, unsaved changes will be lost, so be sure to save transforms regularly while editing.\n\nTransforms\n\nThe Transform tool can be used to take basic melodies, or chordal outlines, and complicate them by \ntransforming in common jazz idioms. These idioms that transform uses are defined from a \ntransformational grammar built into Impro-Visor. A transform is just a list of substitutions to be \napplied to a selected melody. \n\nThe proccess of applying a transform and each further grammar structure is described at the bottom \nof the help document. \n\nGUI:\nSince a transform is just a list of transforms, the list on the lower left of the panel shows all of the \nsubstitutions in the currently opened transform. \n\nSubstitutions\n\n\tSubstitutions are a wrapper for transformations, which are explained further down, and \n\tare used to group them. They can be used to represent all implementations of an idiom, \n\tmaking it the representation for an idiom in whole for the grammar. There are four \n\tdifferent parts to a substitution.\n\n\tSubstitution Parts:\n\t* name \t\t\t- The name that displays for the substitution in the list, for easy \n\t\t\t   \t   identification. Cannot have spaces\n\t* type\t\t\t- There are two types of substitutions, motifs and embellishments. \n\t\t\t   \t   They are described more below, but each idiom has to be either \n\t\t\t  \t   of the two and they determine when a substitution is attempted \n\t\t\t  \t   to be applied to a melody. \n\t* weight\t\t- Integer that determines how often the substitution will try to be \n\t\t\t   \t   applied and is relative to the other substitution's weights in the \n\t\t\t     \t   transform that have the same substitution type. \n\t* transformations\t- A list of transformations that are defined below.\n\n\tSubstitution Types:\n\t* Motifs are substitutions that likely involve more than one note and give a sense of \n\t   intended progresses between the notes. (e.g. triplet arpeggiation, mordents)\n\t* Embellishments on the otherhand are substitutions that fluff just the target notes of a \n\t   solo and dont change much more than that. (e.g. grace notes, approach tones)\n\n\tSince motifs change the color and tone and embellishments do not, they should not be \n\tapplied to a melody at the same time. For consistent converage of both types of \n\tsubstitutions, substitutions are applied to a melody in two iterators. \n\t\n\tFirst all the motifs are applied to a melody giving a resulting initial transformed melody. \n\tThen the embellishments are applied to the initial transformed melody yielding a final \n\ttransformed melody. That is what is then placed back into the leadsheet. \n\t\n\tGUI:\n\tWhen you click on a substitution from the substitution list, its transformations will appear in \n\tthe list to its right. Tranformations added to that list will then be added to the currently \n\tselected substitution. \n\t\n\tThere are also buttons and boxes to change each of these parts for any selected substitution.\n\n\nTransformations\n\n\tTransformations are basically specific implementations of an idiom that will always \n\tdeterministically result in the same thing given the same input melody selection. \n\tTransformations are defined by two things: a way to transform notes, and a hueristic to \n\tdetermine whether or not a transformation should be applied to a group of notes. \n\n\tTransformation in Grammar Form:\n\t\n\t(transformation\n\t\t(description <string-without-spaces>)\n\t\t(weight <integer>)\n\t\t(source-notes <string> <string> ...)\n\t\t(condition-guard <function>)\n\t\t(target-notes <function|string> <function|string> ...))\n\n\tTransformation Parts:\n\t\t* description\t\t- displays in the list and is used to identify the transformation\n\t\t* weight\t\t- determines how often a transformations is attempted to be \n\t\t\t\t\t   applied, weights are relative to the other transformations in \n\t\t\t\t\t   its substitution\n\t\t* source-notes\t\t- A list of note-variable names used later in the \n\t\t\t\t\t   condition-guard and target-notes. The variable names cannot\n\t\t\t\t\t   be names of functions in the grammar, a possible note string,\n\t\t\t\t\t   a number or contain spaces. (typically they are \"n1\", \"n2\", \n\t\t\t\t\t   \"n3\", etc.) The number of variable names in source-notes \n\t\t\t\t\t   determines how many notes will be transformed. \n\t\t* condition-guard\t- A function that can contain other functions and must return \n\t\t\t\t\t   true for the transformation to be applied (will use variables \n\t\t\t\t\t   names from source-notes).\n\t\t* target-notes\t\t- A list of note-variable names or note returning functions that \n\t\t\t\t\t   replace the source-notes when the transformation is finally \n\t\t\t\t\t   applied.\n\n\tA list of functions the condition-guard and target-notes can use can be found in the\n\tTransform Tab by clicking the button \"Show Transformation Functions\" button.  \n\n\tFor a transformation to be applied, two conditions must be met. The total duration of the \n\tnotes taken in by source-notes must equal the total duration of the notes returned in \n\ttarget-notes. The condition-guard must return true for the note variables bound in \n\tsource-notes. \n\n\tGUI:\n\tThere is a spinner to change the weight of a selected transformation and there is the ability to\n\tadd and delete transformations in the selected substitution. To change other aspects of the\n\ttransformation though requires you to click the Edit Transformation Button.\n\n\tThe Edit Transformation Button will bring up a text area with the actual grammar \n\trepresentation of a transformation, so is only suggested if you know what you are editing.\n\nProccess of Applying a Transform \n\nA Transform is just a list of substitutions. So when it is applied to a melody, it will divide up the\nmelody into selections and transform each. When it is transforming a selection, it orders its \nsubstitutions in a list randomly but with precedence to substitutions with higher weights. It starts\nat the top of the list and tries to apply the selection to the substitution. If the substitution can be\napplied, the selection is modified to the result of the application. If it cannot be applied, the next\nsubstitution in the list is tried. If no substitution can be applied to a particular selection, the \nselection just remains the same. The transformed melody is then placed back into the leadsheet.\n\nProcess of Applying a Substitution\n\nSubstitutions contain a list of transformations. When a substitution is trying to apply itsself to a \nsection of melody, it orders its transformations in a list randomly but with precedence to \ntransformations with higher weights. The substitution will then start at the top of the list and try to \napply the transformation to the melody selection. If the transformation can be applied the result is \nreturned, else the next transformation in the list is tried. If no transformation can be applied to the \nmelody section, then the substitution cannot be applied. \n\nProcess of Applying a Transformation\n\nApplying a transformation takes 3 steps:\n1. The notes in the segment given are associated with variable names in source notes. \n\tIf the segment was \"c4 d4 e2\" and source-notes was (source-notes n1 n2 n3),\n\tThe following would be true: n1 = c4, n2 = d4, n3 = e2\n     If the segment contains too few notes to be associated with source-notes, then the\n     the transformation cannot be applied.\n2. Now that the variables-names now have notes associated with them, we can check the validity\n    of the condition-guard. The condition guard is run and if it returns false, the transformation\n    cannot be applied. If it returns true, then step 3 is run.\n3. Now that the huersitic is satisfied, we can get our resulting notes. Each function in target-notes\n    is evaluated and if every note in the resulting list is valid, then the segment given is now replaced\n    with the notes in the evaluated target-notes. If there is an invalid note, or a function is unable to\n    be evaluated, the transform cannot be applied. \n");

        criticHelpTextArea.setText("Help for Critic\n\nThe critic feature allows you to grade solos using a trained artificial neural \nnetwork, a machine learning technique loosely inspired by the human brain.\n\nNeural network critics can be trained using Impro-Visor or loaded from \nweight files (both using the \"Neural Network Learning\" tab of the Grammar\n Control Window, accessible via Utilities > Grammar). Note that these weight \nfiles are different than the Deep Learning connectomes, which, while also\n neural network weights, use a different format. Once a critic is loaded, it \ncan grade solos, generate solos above a certain grade (using grammars) and \nload several neural network critics in parallel to guess which musician would \nhave been most likely to play a given passage.\n\nTraining\n\nTo train the critic, you need a .training.data file of saved licks and grades to \nserve as examples for the neural network. One such file comes with \nImpro-Visor currently. Further training files can be generated from Grammar \nOptions > Show Critic Exporter at the top of the Grammar Control Window. \nIf the option just above it, \"Send Licks to Critic\" is selected, the \"Lick Saving \nand Grading\" panel will save a lick with label and grade. Licks saved here \nwill appear in the Critic Exporter window, where you can save them to \n.training.data files for neural network training.\n\nOnce you have a .training.data file, you can train a critic by going to the \n\"Neural Network Learning\" tab of the grammar controls. First, set up your\n neural network structure by adding and removing layers (with the add/remove \nlayer buttons) and changing the number of neurons and activation function in \neach layer (by double clicking on the relevant value). After your network is set \nup, click \"Generate Weight File\" to train the network and save the weights \nwith the name designated by the \"weight file\" field.\n\nLoading Weights\n\nIn order to use the critic feature, you have to load a generated weight file. \nOnce you have loaded a weight file, the \"Melody Generator\" tab of the Grammar \nControl Window changes to include the Critic Options panel.\n\nUsing the Critic to Grade\n\nFrom the Critic Options panel, you can grade a lick you have selected in the main \nImpro-Visor window. Grades are assigned by the neural network based on the \ntraining data used to generate the weight file. If you select less than the entire \npiece in the main window, you can use the \"Step Forward\" and \"Step Backward\" \nbuttons to move the selection forwards and backwards in the piece, and use the \n\"Grade Selected Lick\" and \"Generate Better Lick\" (described below) on only that \nselection. For example, if you have four bars selected, \"Step Forward\" will \nchange your selection to the next four bars instead. \"Offset by Measure\" allows \nyou to move your selection by exactly one measure instead. \"Reset Selection\" will \nundo all changes made to the selection range using the Critic Options panel.\n\nUsing the Critic to Generate Licks\n\nThe panel can also use the critic to generate licks (still using grammars, not any \nsort of deep learning) with better grades. When you push the \"Generate Better Lick\" \nbutton, the system will generate licks with the grammar selected in the main notate \nwindow until it produces one that scores above the threshold in the \"Grade\" box to \nthe left, and deposits the number of solos it generated and threw out because they \nwere below that threshold in the \"Counter\" box. If it takes too many samples, \nImpro-Visor will display an error message. The system also works without a threshold\nif the \"Use Critic\" box is unchecked. The \"Correct All\" button is equivalent to pressing \nthe \"Generate Better Lick\" button, then \"Step Forwards\" until the selection reaches \nthe end of the current chorus.\n\nGuess Musician Feature\n\nUnrelated to the Neural Network Learning interface, you can use the Lick Saving and \nGrading panel to identify which grading scheme a given passage scores best under, \nwhich can be used to guess the musician most likely to play that passage, if you have\nweights from training the neural network on pieces by that musician. To use this \nfeature, the vocab/style-recognition-weights folder in the Impro-Visor files directory\nmust contain a .weights.save file for each musician. These files do not come bundled\nwith Impro-Visor by default, you will have to either contact the developers or train \nthem yourself. If you do have these weight files, you can click \"Prepare Critics\" to set \nup several neural network critics in parallel. Once that happens, the button's text will \nchange to \"Guess Musician\", which you can press to identify which musician the \npassage selected in the main Impro-Visor window best resembles.");

This makes the generation process much faster, but can cause playback\n           issues.\n\n- Risk Level\n        The Risk Level slider determines how often the network should play notes it considers\n        less plausible than other notes.\n        * With the slider in the center, the network will play notes according to its internal\n           model of note likelihood. This is the default.\n        * With the slider on the \"Conservative\" side, the network will avoid notes it considers\n           unlikely. This can produce more consonant melodies, but may have less nuance.\n        * With the slider on the \"Adventurous\" side, the network will choose unlikely notes\n           more often than otherwise. This can add nuance and variation, but may produce\n           dissonant notes or strange rhythms occasionally.\n\n- Expert Weighting\n        The Expert Weighting slider determines how the contour and pitch of the melody are\n        weighted. Specifically, the deep learning network uses two \"experts\", one in control\n        of intervals and the other in control of pitch relative to the chord progression. This\n        slider adjusts how the input of the experts is combined.\n        * With the slider in the center, the network weights each expert equally.\n        * With the slider on the \"Contour\" side, the network favors the advice of the interval\n           expert over the chord expert. This may produce smoother contours at the expense\n           of dissonance.\n        * With the slider on the \"Pitch\" side, the network favors the advice of the chord expert\n           over the interval expert. This may produce more consonant notes at the expense of\n           jagged contours.\n\n- Rest Limiting\n        Occasionally, the trained network may output long stretches of rest. The Rest Limiting\n        checkboxes determine how to handle these long rests.\n        * With \"Don't limit rests\" checked, the network is fully in control of the length of rests.\n        * With \"Force network to play a note after long rest\" checked, after a long rest the network\n           is forced to pick a note without being allowed to continue resting.\n        * With \"Reset network on next bar after long rest\" checked, after a long rest the network\n           memory is wiped and it starts generation from a clean state. This can allow the network\n           to recover from undesired behaviors, but does not always work as well.\n        If the second or third boxes are checked, the length of a \"long rest\" is determined by the\n        selection box \"Rest limit length\".\n\n- Rectification\n        The rectification options allow rectification to be performed to the network output by\n        imposing constraints on the notes that the network can output.\n        * The \"Rectify network output\" checkbox, if checked, prohibits the network from choosing\n           notes that do not fit in the current chord. If the \"Allow color tones\" checkbox is also\n           checked, the network can choose either chord tones or color tones.\n        * The \"Merge repeated pitches\" checkbox, if checked, prevents the network from articulating\n           the same pitch multiple times in a row. If the network would choose to do this, the\n           previous note is sustained instead.\n\nTraining the network:\nThe training process for the deep learning network parameters is computationally expensive\nand mathematically complex. As such, the training functionality is not directly available in\nImpro-Visor. Additional connectomes can be trained using the lstmprovisor-python project,\navailable at https://github.com/Impro-Visor/lstmprovisor-python.");
